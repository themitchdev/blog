### Customer Relationship Management Application

_**Technology: Java, MySQL, JavaFX, Javadocs**_

A simple CRM application written in Java and the JavaFX library for creating the GUI. This application connects to a MySQL database utilizing the JDBC connector.
Documentation created using Javadocs. MVC was used as the software architechture pattern. Lambda functions were implemented which helped me reduce the amount of code written. This project was written in about 3000 lines of code.
